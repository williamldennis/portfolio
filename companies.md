"I’m a former VP of Product and two-time startup founder with a background in building joyful, engaging consumer products — from social platforms to health tools. I recently shifted my focus to hands-on prototyping using AI, full-stack web, and creative design to bring playful, behavior-changing ideas to life. I’m looking for roles or collaborators where I can blend product leadership with creativity, storytelling, and technology to make something people love."
