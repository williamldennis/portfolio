summary: 'Leapfrogging software to a digital employee future'

Yesterday I set up openclaw (I recommend you check it out and set it up yourself). 

It’s about the glimpse into what digital employees are and what that means for the future of software. In short, most software is going away. 

I wanted to create a meta ad campaign in order to test some new messaging around a product we’re building. 

Normally, I would have done the research, created messaging for each audience segment, created images in figma for each message, uploaded the images to facebook campaign manager, input the campaign details, and set the campaign live. 

All of this slow, painstaking, and a means to an end. 

Instead, I chatted with openclaw in telegram about my goals. After some configuring, my openclaw (I named it ChillyWilly) send me images for review right in telegram. I approved some, and it posted them directly into a ad campaign draft that it created for me within fb ad manager. 

In the process, it leapfrogged my interactions with figma completely. 

We’re witnessing the end of software and a future where we have digital employees delivering results. 

It’s beautiful.
